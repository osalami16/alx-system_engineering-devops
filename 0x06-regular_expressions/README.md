# Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. All my regex is built for the Oniguruma library.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

_Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line._

* **0. Simply matching Holberton**
  * [0-simply_match_holberton.rb](./0-simply_match_holberton.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `School`.

* **1. Repetition Token #0**
  * [1-repetition_token_0.rb](./1-repetition_token_0.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbn` with between 2-5 `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **2. Repetition Token #1**
  * [2-repetition_token_1.rb](./2-repetition_token_1.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hn` with 0 or 1 occurrences of `b` and 0 or 1
  occurrences of `t` in between `h` and `n`.
